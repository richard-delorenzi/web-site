# Reliable news sources

## Bias
All news is bias. Someone selected what to write about. However some news sources are more bias than others.

## Opinion
Some news sources are full of opinion. Some just state facts. It is less likely for a fact to be wrong than an opinion to be wrong. (#todo# add citation) Many news sources state facts in an OK way, then give an incompatible opinion. If you have the same bias as the news source, then you may not notice.

## What to do
Choose news sources that focus on factual writing and avoid opinion. 

You could try to avoid bias reporting. This is not easy, there are tools to help with this. However, what they see as centrist, is a long way right of centre. This is because we live in a right wing world. And even a centrist view will miss out very important facts.

A better approach is to seek view from all points of view: extreme left and extreme right. 

e.g. When trying to check the viability of carbon capture. Checkout the work of the scientist trying to get it to work. Check out what the oil companies have to say. And, if necessary check that the detractors have to say. I say if necessary, because at this point you will have a very bias pro-carbon-capture point of view, and enough evidence to see that it is uneconomic. As you continue reading on the other side e.g drilled podcast, you will see that it is a smoke screen, to divert our attention from changes that could work.
