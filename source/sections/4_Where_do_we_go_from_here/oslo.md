# The city of oslo

The country of Norway has sales of vehicles at over 90% electric.
The city of Oslo is going farther.

> ### 1.3.1 A greener and more attractive city
> Oslo must be an attractive metropolis and capital city. The design of the
streets should reinforce the role and identity of the urban fabric. The dense
and multi-purpose city should be extended into new areas. The streets
constitute a large part of the urban public spaces. They are integral elements
if we are to achieve the goals adopted in the Municipal Plan and the Climate
Strategy (City of Oslo 2019 and 2020).
As stated in the Architecture Policy adopted in 2020, the street should be
recognised as one of the most important communal spaces of the city.
A city that prioritises good city life will prioritise street areas for pedestrians,
cyclists, public transport and public spaces. Furthermore, adequate space
must be set aside for deliveries and transport of people with disabilities.
Oslo aims to be a green city. Green spaces are important social arenas with
a big influence on public health. Green spaces can support biodiversity,
provide important carbon stores in the vegetation and soil, clean the air
and assist in stormwater management and temperature regulation.
Green spaces must therefore be incorporated into plans and projects more
extensively than in the past. The design of the streets has a major bearing
on the quality of life for the people moving through- and spending time in
the City of Oslo.
