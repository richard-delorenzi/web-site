# A new story

A new paradigm is coming. It has to come, because the old way is dying.
The new way will solve many of the problems that the old way created. Let go of the old.

However the new way is scary. Especially for those of us that can see it coming. It is scary because much of what we learnt in the old way, is useless or wrong in the new way. We have to unlearn, and we need to learn new things. 

It will seem at first that everything that you know will have to be unlearnt. Do not worry, you are a good learner, and not everything has to be un-learnt. Many of the thinking strategies will still be of use. And, the laws of physics will not change; only how you apply them. 

I can not tell you what to do. I am but a fellow traveller. I can guide you, You can guide me, as we travel together.
