# Current state of this site
Just a bunch of references, and a few articles.

# Plan
Start with What is possible now, and How did we get here.
These are the most out of date in the original BTCI work, and they seem to be the most overlooked.

I will first add positive article: what is possible now. There are people trying to dishearten as by making is think there is no solution. There is.

I will also focus on how we got here. The tricks and schemes to fool us.

There will be no original material. It will summarise and link to other peoples works (I am a teacher, not a researcher).
