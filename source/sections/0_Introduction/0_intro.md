# Introduction
A web site about climate change. It uses a model from the Be The Change Initiative from the  Pachamama Alliance.

[A video from the awakening the dreamer symposium](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PbS_V3qgxdI) from the Pachamama Alliance.

* Where are we? 
* How did we get here?
* What is possible now?
* Where do we go from here?

## Environment, Social, Spiritual
There has been a disconnect between

* Environmental sustainability
* Social justice
* Spiritual fulfilment

These are not separate things, they need to be re-connected.
