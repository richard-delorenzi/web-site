# Introduction
A web site about climate change. It uses a model from the Be The Change Initiative: 

* Where are we? 
* How did we get here?
* What is possible now?
* Where do we go from here?

## Environment, Social, Spiritual
There has been a disconnect between

* Environmental sustainability
* Social justice
* Spiritual fulfilment

These are not separate things, they need to be re-connected. 

## Journey together
I don't have all the answers, but I am learning. We can learn together. 

The first step is to drop what we already know, drop opinion. Look at evidence.

## Know nothing
The only true knowledge is to know nothing.

Be ready to forget everything that you know, do not try to mould new evidence to what you already know, mould yourself to the new evidence. However, do not be like a leaf blowing in the wind: Do not flit between ideas. Gather evidence, but come to no conclusion â€” for as long as possible. Take your time.

## Bias
All evidence is bias, so look at evidence from many sources. Where possible Look at highly bias evidence from all sources (this can be difficult as much of evidence from fossil fuel companies is not bias, it is just plain intentional lies). 

## A new story

A new paradigm is coming. It has to come, because the old way is dying.
The new way will solve many of the problems that the old way created. Let go of the old.

However the new way is scary. Especially for those of us that can see it coming. It is scary because much of what we learnt in the old way, is useless or wrong in the new way. We have to unlearn, and we need to learn new things. 

It will seem at first that everything that you know will have to be unlearnt. Do not worry, you are a good learner, and not everything has to be un-learnt. Many of the thinking strategies will still be of use. And, the laws of physics will not change; only how you apply them. 

I can not tell you what to do. I am but a fellow traveller. I can guide you, You can guide me, as we travel together.
