## RethinkX

[RethinkX](https://www.rethinkx.com/) shows how we can fix 90% of the climate-change emissions in less than 15 years. They give us 3 areas of focus: Transport, Energy, and Food. It is the first plan, that I feel will work, and is worth doing even if there is no climate-change. It will make thinks cheaper: for example there renewable energy plan, uses only economic argument. It is the cheapest solution (cheaper than: all fossil fuels), and provides secondary benefits. The only entities that will be worse off are fossil fuel companies.

## Transport

### Driving, Cycling and Walking

* Where to use [Roundabouts](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G24x26s3Hjg), where not to use them, and what type.

* The dutch made it better for walking, cycling, **and** driving.

## Renewable energy
[Renewable electricity is inevitable](

) We just need to get out of the way. Texas is the USA state with the most renewable. It also has the least renewable incentives and regulation (for fossil fuel and renewable). Renewables are wining on economic reasons alone.

[UK electricity generation is already averaging over 30% over a year](

). On some days fossil fuels are less that 10%.
