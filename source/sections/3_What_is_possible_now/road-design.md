# Driving, Cycling and Walking

Our current way of designing roads is not best for cycling, walking or **Driving**. We need to do better for all users.

Most actions that make it better for walking, cycling, or public transport, also make it better for driving. However there are other things that can be done to improve driving, without sacrificing other modes.
