# Driving, Cycling and Walking

Our current way of designing roads is not best for cycling, walking or **Driving**. We need to do better for all users.

Most actions that make it better for walking, cycling, or public transport, also make it better for driving. However there are other things that can be done to improve driving, without sacrificing other modes.

## Neighbourhoods
> ### We will build this place, and they will play — A Co-housing project 
> My boy was born today, where will he play? </br>
> Will he play indoors on his own, all alone? </br>
> Will he play in the road, with the cars? </br>
> Will he play in the park, far away? </br>
> </br>
> Let us get rid of the cars. Let us know our neighbours Let us build a community together. </br>
> Let us talk in the streets, with no cars. </br>
> </br>
> Let the children play. </br>
> Let the adults play. </br>
> Let the old people play. </br> 
> Let the children play. </br>
