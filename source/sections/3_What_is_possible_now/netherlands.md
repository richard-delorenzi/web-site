# The Netherlands
The Netherlands was once a car ridden hell-scape. However, it is now the cycling and walking capital of the world, and also a nice place to drive. Thanks to prioritising walking and cycling, they have made it a much better place for walking, cycling, and **driving**.


## How they did it

Some of the things that they did are: separate travel routes into roads and streets. A road if for getting some where, a street is a destination.
