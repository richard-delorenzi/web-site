# RethinkX

[RethinkX](https://www.rethinkx.com/) shows how we can fix 90% of the climate-change emissions in less than 15 years. They give us 3 areas of focus:

* Transport
* Energy
* Food

It is the first plan, that I feel will work, and is worth doing even if there is no climate-change. It will make thinks cheaper: for example there renewable energy plan, uses only economic argument. It is the cheapest solution (cheaper than: all fossil fuels), and provides secondary benefits. The only entities that will be worse off are fossil fuel companies.
