# Electric Vehicles

## Cars, scooters, bicycles, trains

## Electric Cars
### Ease of use
Electric cars have no gears, so are easy to drive. They are also smoother and quieter to drive.

### Fuelling
Fuel is cheaper, and easier. Most of the time, most people charge at home when they are asleep. Rarely visiting a fuel station. The electricity is much cheaper that Petrol/Gas/Diesel. And, can be made cheaper if you subscribe to a special time of day rate: E.g. Charging in the middle of the night is much cheaper.

### Efficiency
Even if the electric grid was 100% coal, then an EV is marginally more efficient. However, most grids are better than this. The UK is already ⅓ renewable, and less than ⅓ fossil fuel. It will improve.

### Simplicity
EVs are simpler, with fewer moving parts.

## Scooters and bicycles
There are a range of these. Some very powerful (they should be licensed like small motorbikes). However, most are of moderate power. Some only assist so that you have to pedal. While some you only need to pedal to get started (This is a safety feature. There may be alternate ways to add this safety.). 

### How many electric cars
See sections on designing for cycling and walking. We need fewer cars, but the cars that exist should be electric. The majority of electric cars should be very very small, or very very big: scooters, bicycles, trains or trams.
