## Cost of change
If you were to line up all existing solution to climate change in cost order, and started implementing them from the cheap end, then you would solve 80% of climate change before using a solution that had a possitive cost. 

Yes the first 80% will save money. (Unless you are an oil company. In this case it will affect profits.)
