## Structure
### Single responsibility principle
We follow the single responsibility principle. The site is made of separate parts.

* Layout (css)
* Style (css)
* Structure (html)
* Content (markdown, â€¦)

### File names
For now. File names can not have spaces. Use a `_`

## Vendor lock-in
We will avoid vendor lock-in, by using open-standards.
We have an open build system, that builds open output. 
All tools are [Free-Software](https://www.gnu.org/philosophy/free-sw.en.html) and can be ported to another platform if needed.
