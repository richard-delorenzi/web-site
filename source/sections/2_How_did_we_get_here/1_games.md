# Games

## Zero sum vs positive sum
We have been told that we have to chose: this or that. If you want this good thing, then you will loose this other good thing. This is not true. This is the zero sum game model. Some things are zero sum. But there are ways to <q>grow the pie</q>. 

## Finite games vs infinite games
We are playing a infinite game (the game of life). This game has no end, no point at which you can say <q>I have won</q>. It is not an Olympic sport. Instead this game keeps going. However, we have been playing it like it is finite, using finite rules. 

## GDP
All games have rules and goals. GDP is the wrong goal. If GDP is the goal, then you win by spending on things that make life better, and by spending on things that make life worse.

GDP is the measure of inputs (some say it is a measure of outputs, however all outputs of one part of the system are inputs to another. Total inputs = total outputs) to the system. Therefore at easy way to increase GDP is to increase waste.

## Growth is not possible
A hamster doubles in mass every day for the first two weeks of its life. If it continued like this for three months, then it would weigh more than the Earth and Jupiter. By day 104, it would be more massive than the sun.
