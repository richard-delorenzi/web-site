## Zero sum vs positive sum
We have been told that we have to chose: this or that. If you want this good thing, then you will loose this other good thing. This is not true. This is the zero sum game model. Some things are zero sum. But there are ways to <q>grow the pie</q>.

## Grows is not possible
