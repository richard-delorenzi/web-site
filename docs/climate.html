<article id="article_1_a_new_story">
<h1>A new story</h1>
<p>A new paradigm is coming. It has to come, because the old way is dying.
The new way will solve many of the problems that the old way created. Let go of the old.</p>
<p>However the new way is scary. Especially for those of us that can see it coming. It is scary because much of what we learnt in the old way, is useless or wrong in the new way. We have to unlearn, and we need to learn new things. </p>
<p>It will seem at first that everything that you know will have to be unlearnt. Do not worry, you are a good learner, and not everything has to be un-learnt. Many of the thinking strategies will still be of use. And, the laws of physics will not change; only how you apply them. </p>
<p>I can not tell you what to do. I am but a fellow traveller. I can guide you, You can guide me, as we travel together.</p></article>
<article id="article_1_journey">
<h1>Journey together</h1>
<p>I don't have all the answers, but I am learning. We can learn together. </p>
<p>The first step is to drop what we already know, drop opinion. Look at evidence.</p>
<h2>Know nothing</h2>
<p>The only true knowledge is to know nothing.</p>
<p>Be ready to forget everything that you know, do not try to mould new evidence to what you already know, mould yourself to the new evidence. However, do not be like a leaf blowing in the wind: Do not flit between ideas. Gather evidence, but come to no conclusion — for as long as possible. Take your time. </p>
<p><q>The only true wisdom is in knowing you know nothing.</q> — Socrates (the ancient Greek philosopher).</p>
<h2>Bias</h2>
<p>All evidence is bias, so look at evidence from many sources. Where possible Look at highly bias evidence from all sources (this can be difficult as much of evidence from fossil fuel companies is not bias, it is just plain intentional lies). </p>
<h2>Drop identity</h2>
<p>Do not say I am a scientist, I am a sceptic, I am a religious person. To do this you have already made up your mind. Let go of identity. Just look.</p>
<p>If you need an identity, then say I am a seeker. Say I don't know, but I will do my best to find-out. </p></article>

<p>Start with What is possible now, and How did we get here.
These are the most out of date in the original BTCI work, and they seem to be the most overlooked.</p>
<p>I will first add positive article: what is possible now. There are people trying to dishearten as by making is think there is no solution. There is.</p>
<p>I will also focus on how we got here. The tricks and schemes to fool us.</p>
<p>There will be no original material. It will summarise and link to other peoples works (I am a teacher, not a researcher).</p></article>

<h1>Games</h1>
<h2>Zero sum vs positive sum</h2>
<p>We have been told that we have to chose: this or that. If you want this good thing, then you will loose this other good thing. This is not true. This is the zero sum game model. Some things are zero sum. But there are ways to <q>grow the pie</q>. </p>
<h2>Finite games vs infinite games</h2>
<p>We are playing a infinite game (the game of life). This game has no end, no point at which you can say <q>I have won</q>. It is not an Olympic sport. Instead this game keeps going. However, we have been playing it like it is finite, using finite rules. </p>
<h2>GDP</h2>
<p>All games have rules and goals. GDP is the wrong goal. If GDP is the goal, then you win by spending on things that make life better, and by spending on things that make life worse.</p>
<p>GDP is the measure of inputs (some say it is a measure of outputs, however all outputs of one part of the system are inputs to another. Total inputs = total outputs) to the system. Therefore at easy way to increase GDP is to increase waste.</p>
<h2>Growth is not possible</h2>
<p>A hamster doubles in mass every day for the first two weeks of its life. If it continued like this for three months, then it would weigh more than the Earth and Jupiter. By day 104, it would be more massive than the sun.</p></article>

<h1>The Netherlands</h1>
<p>The Netherlands was once a car ridden hell-scape. However, it is now the cycling and walking capital of the world, and also a nice place to drive. Thanks to prioritising walking and cycling, they have made it a much better place for walking, cycling, and <strong>driving</strong>.</p>
<h2>How they did it</h2>
<p>Some of the things that they did are: separate travel routes into roads and streets. A road if for getting some where, a street is a destination.</p>

<h1>The city of oslo</h1>
<p>The country of Norway has sales of vehicles at over 90% electric.
The city of Oslo is going farther:</p>
<blockquote>
<h3>1.3.1 A greener and more attractive city</h3>
<p>Oslo must be an attractive metropolis and capital city. The design of the
streets should reinforce the role and identity of the urban fabric. The dense
and multi-purpose city should be extended into new areas. The streets
constitute a large part of the urban public spaces. They are integral elements
if we are to achieve the goals adopted in the Municipal Plan and the Climate
Strategy (City of Oslo 2019 and 2020).
As stated in the Architecture Policy adopted in 2020, the street should be
recognised as one of the most important communal spaces of the city.
A city that prioritises good city life will prioritise street areas for pedestrians,
cyclists, public transport and public spaces. Furthermore, adequate space
must be set aside for deliveries and transport of people with disabilities.
Oslo aims to be a green city. Green spaces are important social arenas with
a big influence on public health. Green spaces can support biodiversity,
provide important carbon stores in the vegetation and soil, clean the air
and assist in stormwater management and temperature regulation.
Green spaces must therefore be incorporated into plans and projects more
extensively than in the past. The design of the streets has a major bearing
on the quality of life for the people moving through- and spending time in
the City of Oslo.

<h1>RethinkX</h1>
<p><a href="https://www.rethinkx.com/" rel="nofollow">RethinkX</a> shows how we can fix 90% of the climate-change emissions in less than 15 years. They give us 3 areas of focus:</p>
<ul>
<li>Transport</li>
<li>Energy</li>
<li>Food</li>
</ul>
<p>It is the first plan, that I feel will work, and is worth doing even if there is no climate-change. It will make thinks cheaper: for example there renewable energy plan, uses only economic argument. It is the cheapest solution (cheaper than: all fossil fuels), and provides secondary benefits. The only entities that will be worse off are fossil fuel companies.</p></article>
<article id="article_road-design">
<h1>Driving, Cycling and Walking</h1>
<p>Our current way of designing roads is not best for cycling, walking or <strong>Driving</strong>. We need to do better for all users.</p>
<p>Most actions that make it better for walking, cycling, or public transport, also make it better for driving. However there are other things that can be done to improve driving, without sacrificing other modes.</p>
<h2>Neighbourhoods</h2>
<blockquote>
<h3>We will build this place, and they will play — A Co-housing project</h3>
<p>My boy was born today, where will he play? </br>
Will he play indoors on his own, all alone? </br>
Will he play in the road, with the cars? </br>
Will he play in the park, far away? </br>
</br>
Let us get rid of the cars. Let us know our neighbours Let us build a community together. </br>
Let us talk in the streets, with no cars. </br>
</br>
Let the children play. </br>
Let the adults play. </br>
Let the old people play. </br> 
Let the children play. </br></p>

<article id="article_news_sources">
<h1>Reliable news sources</h1>
<h2>Bias</h2>
<p>All news is bias. Someone selected what to write about. However some news sources are more bias than others.</p>
<h2>Opinion</h2>
<p>Some news sources are full of opinion. Some just state facts. It is less likely for a fact to be wrong than an opinion to be wrong. (#todo# add citation) Many news sources state facts in an OK way, then give an incompatible opinion. If you have the same bias as the news source, then you may not notice.</p>
<h2>What to do</h2>
<p>Choose news sources that focus on factual writing and avoid opinion. </p>
<p>You could try to avoid bias reporting. This is not easy, there are tools to help with this. However, what they see as centrist, is a long way right of centre. This is because we live in a right wing world. And even a centrist view will miss out very important facts.</p>
<p>A better approach is to seek view from all points of view: extreme left and extreme right. </p>
<p>e.g. When trying to check the viability of carbon capture. Checkout the work of the scientist trying to get it to work. Check out what the oil companies have to say. And, if necessary check that the detractors have to say. I say if necessary, because at this point you will have a very bias pro-carbon-capture point of view, and enough evidence to see that it is uneconomic. As you continue reading on the other side e.g drilled podcast, you will see that it is a smoke screen, to divert our attention from changes that could work.</p>
